TASK 1: Input Mask (Phone Number Formatting)

The objective is to create an input mask that formats telephone numbers in real-time. It should present a user entered phone number xxxxxxxx as something like xxx-xxx-xxxx. Note: Choosing the - here as it is slightly easier to implement than with () characters for (XXX) XXX - XXXX. We will assume US phone numbers to keep it simple. The presented example uses Brooklyn College's phone number, 718-951-5000


TASK 2: Input Mask (Credit Card Verification)

Create an elegant user experience for verifying credit card number inputs. The implementation proposed here is to create a textbox that has an underlying luhn algorithm implementation in vanilla JavaScript.
